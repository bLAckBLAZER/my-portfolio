        <p class="blog-content">
            Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a
            simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Pythonâ€™s elegant syntax and dynamic typing,
            together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application
            development in many areas on most platforms.

        <h2 class="blog-subheading">First Python program:</h2>
        <p>
            Let's start your python journey with the classic "Hello World!" program, shall we?
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code class="code-background">
            print("Hello World!")
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>That's it! No kidding. You just created your first python program to display a message on the console. No
            class, no creation of objects, no semi-colons. It's that easy! Cool, right?</p>

        <h2 class="blog-subheading">Let's create some variables:</h2>
        <p>
            Variables are integral part of any programming languages. They store any data you want and we can use them
            anywhere you want. If we want to change the value at some point, it saves us the trouble of making changes
            at every place the value or data is being used by just changing the value at variable assignment point.
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code class="code-background">
            name = "Omkar Jadhav"
            age = 22
            isGraduated = True
            height = 175.26
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
            In Python, we also have various datatypes like integer, string, boolean, etc. But it saves you the trouble of restricting or pre-assigning a datatype to the variable while its declaration. 

            Now you can use these variables wherever you want.
            <pre>
                <code class="code-background">
            name = "Omkar Jadhav"
            age = 22

            newAge = age + 5

            print("Hello! My name is " + name)
            print("My current age is "+str(age) +
            ". After 5 years, I will be",newAge,"years old.")
                </code>
            </pre>

            Running above code will give you below output:
            <pre>
                <code class="code-background">
            Hello! My name is Omkar Jadhav
            My current age is 22. After 5 years, I will be  27  years old.
                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>
    </div>
