        <p class="blog-content">
            Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a
            simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Pythonâ€™s elegant syntax and dynamic typing,
            together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application
            development in many areas on most platforms.
        </p>
        <h2 class="blog-subheading">First Python program:</h2>
        <p>
            Let's start your python journey with the classic "Hello World!" program, shall we?
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code class="code-background">
            print("Hello World!")
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>That's it! No kidding. You just created your first python program to display a message on the console. No
            class, no creation of objects, no semi-colons. It's that easy! Cool, right?</p>

        <h2 class="blog-subheading">Let's create some variables:</h2>
        <p>
            Variables are integral part of any programming languages. They store any data you want and we can use them
            anywhere you want. If we want to change the value at some point, it saves us the trouble of making changes
            at every place the value or data is being used by just changing the value at variable assignment point.
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code class="code-background">
            name = "Omkar Jadhav"
            age = 22
            isGraduated = True
            height = 175.26
            </code>
        </pre>
        <p>
            In Python, we also have various datatypes like integer, string, boolean, etc. But it saves you the trouble of restricting or pre-assigning a datatype to the variable while its declaration. 

            Now you can use these variables wherever you want.
            <pre>
                <code class="code-background">
            name = "Omkar Jadhav"
            age = 22

            newAge = age + 5

            print("Hello! My name is " + name)
            print("My current age is "+str(age) +
            ". After 5 years, I will be",newAge,"years old.")
                </code>
            </pre>

            Running above code will give you below output:
            <pre>
                <code class="code-background">
            Hello! My name is Omkar Jadhav
            My current age is 22. After 5 years, I will be 27 years old.
                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>
        <h2 class="blog-subheading">Functions in python:</h2>
        <p>
            Functions are defined in python using "def" keyword. They can be created anywhere you want and can be called anywhere you like. Comfortable, isn't it?
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code class="code-background">
            def myFunction():
                print("inside function")
            
            myfunction()
            </code>
        </pre>
        Running above code will give you below output:
        <pre>
            <code class="code-background">
        inside function
            </code>
        </pre>

        <p>
            You can also pass arguments in a function. These passed arguments can be used in the function whenever needed. Here is an example:
        </p>
        <pre>
            <code class="code-background">
        def myFunction(firstName, lastName):
            print(firstName)
            print(lastName)
            
        myfunction("omkar","jadhav")
            </code>
        </pre>
        Running above code will give you below output:
        <pre>
            <code class="code-background">
        omkar
        jadhav
            </code>
        </pre> 
        <p>
            <strong>Note: </strong>Indentations are very important in Python. They let Python know which part of code belongs to which area. You also have to be careful with use of spaces and tabs sometimes. Jumbling them up can cuase you a nightmare while debugging. 
        </p>

        <h2>Lists in Python:</h2>
        <p>Lists are very useful in python and you will be using them a lot while solving problems. It is equivalent to arrays in other languages.But not exactly! There is another datastucture especially for Arrays in python as well...but for now lets not worry about it.</p>
        <p>Lists can contain any type of data you want in it. It need not be of one type only. You can include an integer, string or any other object in a list. Here is an example of defining a list:</p>

        <pre>
            <code class="code-background">
        listOfThings = ["water",10,12.92,True]
        print(listOfThings)
            </code>
        </pre> 
        Running above code will give you below output:
        <pre>
            <code class="code-background">
        ['water', 10, 12.92, True]
            </code>
        </pre> 

        <h2>Append in lists: </h2>
        <p>To add elements in a list we use .append() method. It takes an input and adds it at the end of the list</p>
        
        <pre>
            <code class="code-background">
        listOfThings = ["water",10,12.92,True]
        
        listOfThings.append("fire")
        print(listOfThings)
            </code>
        </pre> 
        Running above code will give you below output:
        <pre>
            <code class="code-background">
        ['water', 10, 12.92, True, 'fire']
            </code>
        </pre>
        <h2>Pop elements from lists: </h2>
        <p>You can also remove an element present at a position from the list using pop() function. It takes the index of the element you want to remove from the list. By default it removes the last element from the list.</p>

        <pre>
            <code class="code-background">
        listOfThings = [12,14,16,18]
        
        listOfThings.pop()
        print(listOfThings)

        listOfThings.pop(2)
        print(listOfThings)
            </code>
        </pre> 
        Running above code will give you below output:
        <pre>
            <code class="code-background">
        [12, 14, 16]
        [12, 14]
            </code>
        </pre>
